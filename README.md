# Indoor Flying Data 
As a previous indoor skydiving instructor, I thought it would only be suitable to practice data engineering and pandas using what I know. 

This is a system that stores data about flyers and offers ways to extract such data.

## Improvements
There many improvements ahead. Currently there are only getters, but we need more getters, some setters and also visualization!
