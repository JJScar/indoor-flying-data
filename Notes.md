# Goals
- Building a flyer management system
    - Track all flyers who use the tunnel (customers and instructors).
    - Store the data in a .csv file for now (like a lightweight database).
    - Analyze the data regularly for insights (e.g. level distribution, how many are current, instructor stats).
    - Allow easy data entry and querying from a CLI or script.
